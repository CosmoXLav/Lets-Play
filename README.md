## Whats the Mission
Create a code quiz with a repository that has a unique name and deploy URL with no errors that applies a clean and polished style. Doing this project it should be easy to begin and navigate with a click of a button that begins a timer. Questions will appear and when answered correctly, another question will appear. In the situation an answer is incorrect, time will be subtracted from the timer. The game ends when the timer goes to 0 and you will have the option to save with your initals.
